#DATA WAREHOUSE AND ANALYTICS PROJECT

## Requirements for project

### Build a Data warehouse

The aim is to build a data warehouse using SQL server so as to gather data and ultimately perform some analysis on it

**Specific:**

1. Source: Import the data from CSV files
2. Clean Data: Resolve and data errors to refine for actual analysis
3. Integration: Combine multiple input sources of data into one model
4. Historization: As data sources are static , there is no need for maintaining history of the data
5. Documenting: Documentation is to be prepared to provide easy overview of entire project’s scope
